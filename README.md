Collection of Scout Motors features

#### What is this page?
I needed a bookmarked page for all of the _nuanced_ features confirmed or speculated by Scout Motors for its two upcoming vehicles, the Traveller and the Terra. With receipts.

#### What is this page not?
Really well known items like 'is it EV' or the Harvester. If it gets covered in really high level mainstream articles, it doesn't belong on this list.

#### How can I add to this?
Go to issues above and add an issue or if you're technical, create a PR.
